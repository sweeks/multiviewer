# Remote Control User Guide

This guide is for people using the iPhone remote (home screen buttons) to drive the
multiviewer. No code knowledge required. The remote controls four Apple TVs, the J-Tech
multiviewer, and soundbar/TV volume.

**Borders show the current target:**

- **Green border**: multiview controls (layout/selection/PIP).
- **Red border**: Apple TV controls (acts like a normal ATV remote for the selected TV).

Switch between green/red with the **Remote** button. Double-tap Remote opens the iOS
Remote app for the selected TV.

## Buttons and what they do

- **Power**: Toggles everything on/off (J-Tech, Apple TVs, TV/soundbar).
- **Remote**: Toggle between multiview (green) and Apple TV (red). Double-tap opens the
  iOS Remote app for the selected TV.
- **TV / Home**:
  - Multiview: Adds a hidden window if fewer than 4 are showing. In fullscreen, toggles
    PIP overlay on/off.
  - Apple TV: Sends the ATV home.
- **Back**:
  - Multiview: Removes/demotes the selected window. In fullscreen PIP, returns focus to
    the full window. From single-window fullscreen, adds a second window. Double-tap
    starts the screensaver on that TV.
  - Apple TV: ATV back/menu.
- **Arrows (Up/Down/Left/Right)**:
  - Apple TV: Sent directly to the selected ATV.
  - Multiview (not fullscreen): Single tap selects the window in that direction; double
    tap swaps the selected TV with that window.
  - Fullscreen without PIP: Left/Right cycle the fullscreen window through visible TVs.
    Up/Down do nothing.
  - Fullscreen with PIP:
    - If full is selected: Up/Down toward the PIP selects the PIP. Left/Right rotate which
      TV is in the PIP. Double-tap any arrow moves the PIP overlay to the corner in that
      direction.
    - If PIP is selected: Up/Down toward full selects full. Left/Right rotate the PIP TV.
      Double-tap any arrow moves the PIP overlay.
- **Select**:
  - Multiview: Toggles fullscreen on the selected window. In fullscreen with PIP: when PIP
    is selected, Select swaps PIP and full and focuses the new full.
  - Apple TV: ATV select/OK.
- **Play/Pause**:
  - Multiview: Toggles the selected window’s border visibility. Double-tap (when not
    fullscreen) toggles submode/layout.
  - Apple TV: ATV play/pause.
- **Volume Up/Down, Mute**: Adjusts volume for the selected TV (each TV remembers its own
  volume/mute). Audio always follows the selected window.
- **Screensaver** (if present): Starts the ATV screensaver on the selected TV.

## Double-tap summary

- Remote (double): Open iOS Remote app for selected TV.
- Back (double, multiview): Start screensaver on that TV.
- Arrows (multiview, not fullscreen): Swap selected TV with the window in that direction.
- Arrows (fullscreen PIP): Move the PIP overlay to the corner in that direction
  (selection/rotation from the single tap is undone before moving).
- Select (fullscreen PIP, PIP selected): Swap PIP and full, stay focused on the new full.

## Quick tips

- Green vs red border tells you where commands go.
- Audio follows the selected window.
- Volume/mute are per-TV; switching TVs restores that TV’s volume state.
- To move the PIP overlay quickly, double-tap arrows; to change which TV is in the PIP,
  use Left/Right while in fullscreen PIP.
- **Volume Up/Down, Mute**: Adjusts volume for the selected TV (each TV remembers its own
  volume/mute). Audio always follows the selected window.
- **Screensaver** (if present): Starts the ATV screensaver on the selected TV.
